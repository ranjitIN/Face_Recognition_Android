# Face Recognition Android with Tensorflow (tflite)

A FaceRecognition  Android application designed for real-time face recognition using TensorFlow Lite models. Unlike traditional face recognition systems that rely on cloud-based processing, this app runs predictions locally on the device. 

## Features

- On-Device Processing: Utilizes TensorFlow Lite to perform face recognition predictions directly on the Android device, eliminating the need for constant internet connectivity and preserving user privacy.

- Real-time Recognition: Achieves fast and accurate face recognition in real-time, enabling users to seamlessly unlock their devices, access secure areas, or personalize user experiences.
